						Australian experts recommend that to reduce the risk from alcohol-related
						disease or injury, healthy adults (who are not pregnant or breastfeeding),
						should drink no more than 10 standard drinks a week and no more than 4
						standard drinks on any one day. The less you drink, the lower your risk of
						harm from alcohol.
						<br />
						An Australian standard drink is a drink containing 10g of alcohol

					<p>
						If you are under 18 experts say that not drinking is the safest option.
						<br />
						If you are pregnant or breastfeeding it is safest for you and your baby not
						to drink alcohol.
						<br />
						By keeping within these low risk guidelines you are likely to look and feel
						better, your sleep and moods may improve, you may find improvements in your
						relationships with family and friends and you will be less likely to
						experience alcohol related problems.

					<p>
						The effects of any drug vary from person to person. The effect is the result
						of three interacting factors:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The drug itself</li>
						<li>The individual user</li>
						<li>The environment in which drug use occurs</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						While the effect that a drug has on a person is determined by many factors,
						the primary factors that influence a drug’s effect are the type of drug and
						the quantity used. It is important to remember that any illicit drug use can
						put you at risk of health, social, financial and legal problems.
					</p>
					<p>
						Illegal drugs are not subject to quality controls and the active ingredient
						is not consistent. You can never be sure what is actually in it and how it
						will affect you. Even ‘one off’ use can lead to serious harms. Federal and
						state laws provide penalties for possessing, using, producing, selling or
						driving under the influence of illicit drugs. Penalties can include fines,
						disqualification from driving, rehabilitation orders and imprisonment. Think
						about how any of these consequences could impact your life.
					</p>
					<p>
						To avoid the risks and harms associated with drugs, the best option is to
						not use them. This can be difficult for some people who may have become
						dependent on them and feel symptoms of withdrawal if they stop or reduce
						their use.

						Australian experts recommend that to reduce the risk from alcohol-related
						disease or injury, healthy adults (who are not pregnant or breastfeeding),
						should drink no more than 10 standard drinks a week 2 standard drinks per
						day and no more than 4 standard drinks on any one day. The less you drink,
						the lower your risk of harm from alcohol.
						<br />

						You are at risk of experiencing sleeping difficulties, nausea, vomiting,
						increased blood pressure, mood swings, anxiety, panic attacks, paranoia,
						flashbacks and increased effects of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia.
					</p>
					<p>
						The effects of any drug vary from person to person. The effect is the result
						of three interacting factors:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The drug itself</li>
						<li>The individual user</li>
						<li>The environment in which drug use occurs</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						While the effect that a drug has on a person is determined by many factors,
						the primary factors that influence a drug’s effect are the type of drug and
						the quantity used. It is important to remember that any illicit drug use can
						put you at risk of health, social, financial and legal problems. These risks
						also apply to prescription medication when taken for reasons other than
						prescribed.
					</p>
					<p>
						Illegal drugs are not subject to quality controls and the active ingredient
						is not consistent. You can never be sure what is actually in it and how it
						will affect you. Even ‘one off’ use can lead to serious harms. Federal and
						state laws provide penalties for possessing, using, producing, selling or
						driving under the influence of illicit drugs. Penalties can include fines,
						disqualification from driving, rehabilitation orders and imprisonment. Think
						about how any of these consequences could impact your life.
					</p>
					<p>
						To avoid the risks and harms associated with drugs, the best option is to
						not use them. This can be difficult for some people who may have become
						dependent on them and feel symptoms of withdrawal if they stop or reduce
						their use.

					<p>
						The effects of mixing opioids/heroin with alcohol, prescription or over the
