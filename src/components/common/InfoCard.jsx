                        <p>
                            The eASSIST is an electronic version of the Alcohol, Smoking and
                            Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) which was developed by
                            the World Health Organization. The ASSIST has eight questions and
                            takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete. The ASSIST helps
                            identify the risks associated with substance use and the
                            personalised feedback helps explore options for change.
